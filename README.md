# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard has been built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals fascinating insights, indicating that a small handful of microbial species (referred to as operational taxonomic units or OTUs in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a web-based dashboard that allows users to interactively explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard features:

- **Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected individual. It uses sample values for the values, OTU IDs as labels, and OTU labels as tooltips.

- **Bubble Chart:** Shows each sample with OTU IDs for the x values, sample values for the y values, sample values for marker size, OTU IDs for marker colors, and OTU labels for text values.

- **Demographic Info Panel:** Provides demographic information about the selected individual. The panel dynamically updates when a new sample is chosen.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js:** A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in the browser.

- **Plotly:** A charting library that helps create interactive plots and dashboards.

- **Bootstrap:** A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

3. Explore the dataset using the interactive charts and dropdown menu.
